Gangs of 4 book is reffered for the design patterns.
There are many benfits to improve the clearity, maintainability and reusability of the code.

Will learn this with the real life example.

Design Patterns -


Section 1 - Introduction
==========
Web application basics with go templates.
 
Web Server <--> Router <--> Handlers <--> DB/JSON/HTML/SomeService

Section 2 - Setting up web application serving static templates
==========

Use of gohtml for creating template, and passing from the go request.
Servier is in *chi* library
Caching of template in the maps and passing the argument from the command line is the new thing I learned.


Section 3 -  Factory Pattern
==========

1. The Factory Pattern
- Simplest of all
- Create an instance of an object with sensible default value (good example is new keyword)


2. The Abstract 
- Common creational pattern
- Create families of related objects without relying on their concrete classes

---------
Used the Factory pattern for creating the Pet object.
